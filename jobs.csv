About The Company

At Covera, we're committed to ensuring high-quality healthcare is more than just a promise. That's why we're leading the way in the emerging science of quality, and connecting providers and payers in their shared quest to improve patient outcomes and care quality. By tackling this challenge, we have the ability to impact millions of lives by raising the standard of care nationwide.

Our initial focus is radiology, where an early and accurate diagnosis has a profound impact on the rest of a patient's care journey. Through our work, which uses clinically-validated science-based tools, we're helping doctors enhance their care, ensuring patients get the right diagnosis, and enabling the healthcare system to support quality improvement at scale.

Through our clinical intelligence platform, we have launched programs that help people access the most effective care and provide doctors with AI-powered quality insights and tools to enhance their care. Today, Covera is partnered with leading employers, payers and healthcare organizations across the US, including Walmart and Microsoft. And, with a pipeline representing over 25% of insured Americans, we are in the early stages of improving care quality for all patients across the globe.

Silencer Shop is a family owned and operated business building first-class software in an industry that is sorely in need of modernized solutions. We have a bold mission, and so we are committed to growing a collaborative, challenging, fun culture where we make cool tech. That means that everyone has a voice, all work is meaningful, and there are no bad ideas. We want to do it the right way the first time and build products that we're proud of.
Desired skills
This position is mid-level. That means that you've been around the block a few times. Those experiences have formed scars, yes, but also given you opinions about how things should work. Here are some things that should resonate for you:
Modern web development - You know how servers, data stores, and network communication works. You also know how all that ends up getting rendered in a browser.
Team-oriented - You want to collaborate with others and know how everything works.
Process - You've been exposed to good processes and bad ones. What works and what doesn't?
Code quality - You should be able to rant at length about what separates great code from poor code.
Tests - You write them without anyone asking and they've saved you at least once.
Passionate - You can get us excited about the awesome things you've done.
Desire to grow - You've got a list of things to learn. Some of the boxes have already been checked.
Love of automation - You hate doing the boring stuff and the risks of doing it by hand.
Cool with legacy code - The good kind of legacy code. That is, legacy code you can touch and make better.
Also cool with new code - We're cooking new stuff from scratch, with all the fun and scary decisions that go with it.
Tech stack
What about the tech stack? Great engineers can pick up new tech without breaking a sweat, but you want to know what you're getting into. The short answer is ""Microsoft"". The long answer is:
C# - Yes, the latest version with all the cool stuff that's in it
.Net - New and old versions
WPF / WinForms - We've got some desktop stuff too

The Company

Astra’s mission is to Improve Life on Earth from Space® by creating a healthier and more connected planet. Today, Astra offers one of the lowest cost-per-launch dedicated orbital launch services of any operational launch provider in the world, and one of the industry’s first flight-proven electric propulsion systems for satellites, Astra Spacecraft Engine™. Astra delivered its first commercial launch to low Earth orbit in 2021, making it the fastest company in history to reach this milestone, just five years after it was founded in 2016. Astra (NASDAQ: ASTR) was the first space launch company to be publicly traded on Nasdaq.

The Team

Software is at the forefront of how we operate at Astra. As a vertically integrated rocket company, every decision we make is data driven from CAD designs to the launch of a rocket, we look for patterns and relationships at each stage of our design, manufacturing, test, and operations. This unprecedented level of integration requires an equally vertically integrated ""operating system"" that gives insight into topics that matter, guiding our decisions.

The Opportunity

As an Python Software Engineer on the Astra OS team, you will join a small but fast-growing team of scrappy ERP engineers (Software and Functional) that work in a cross-functional, collaborative and blame-free environment. On day one, you will be hands-on designing, developing, testing, deploying, and running a modern ERP system to build rockets!

How You’ll Fulfill Your Mission

Learn: Work with cross-functional teams to understand the end-to-end functionality and impact of our ERP system.
Build: Design and develop in Python features in Odoo, to scale with hyper growth of Astra.
Fail fast: Embrace change and iteration over dogma and stagnation.
Dream: Think big in terms of what's possible to build a truly extraordinary ERP system.
Up-level: Continuously work to better yourself and peers --opportunity is boundless!

Why We Value You

You are a Python Software Engineer, preferably with Odoo Manufacturing experience (Aerospace industry experience a plus)
Work closely with project sponsors, product owners, business analysts and technical project managers throughout the planning, implementation and support phases
Involved in requirements gathering
Translating the requirements and solution to technical specs and final validation
You have exceptional problem solving, communication, and collaboration skills. Flexibility and enthusiasm for learning technologies, tools, and ideas

Desired Multipliers

Must have 7 years expertise developing in Python
2 years Odoo experience a plus (with Manufacturing would be awesome and Aerospace industry experience a dream come true)
Demonstrates principles of quality customer service, with the ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams and flexible enough to work with different technical skill levels and skillsets
Knowledge of Kubernetes and GitOps is desirable.
Professional certificates or advanced degrees are desirable
Bachelor’s Degree in Business or technology related

$155,000 - $185,000 a year

The stated compensation range reflects only the targeted base salary range in the San Francisco Bay Area and excludes additional earnings such as bonus, equity, and benefits. If your salary requirements fall outside of the range, we still encourage you to apply.

ITAR Requirements: This position requires compliance with U.S. Government space technology trade restrictions, specifically the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and additional regulations governing satellite, launch vehicle, missile, and other related technologies. All jobs restricted by these regulations will be contingent upon the applicant’s status as a documented U.S. Person or their ability to receive a trade license from the cognizant government agency; in addition to any required company background checks and in compliance with applicable U.S. and California laws. Similarly, positions requiring the ability to work on government contracts or a security clearance are also contingent upon the applicants ability to receive the appropriate clearance and be allowed to work on U.S. government contracts.

You do not need to match every listed expectation to apply for this position. Here at Astra, we know that diverse perspectives foster the innovation we need to be successful, and we are committed to building a team that encompasses a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and skills.
